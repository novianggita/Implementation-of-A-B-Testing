# Implementation-of-A-B-Testing


## Case Study
Here, I will attempt A/B testing in a study of a fast-food restaurant aiming to identify which marketing strategy is most successful in introducing their new product. The success metric will be measured by the total sales of the new product.
- Promotion type 1: Flash sale discount
- Promotion type 2: Special cashback point
- Promotion type 3: Bundling deals

## Data Source
Fast Food Marketing Campaign (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test/data)

## Output, Method, and Tools
- Output: Difference test result, post-hoc test, and dashboard
- Method: test of mean difference (parametric test: ANOVA) and test of median difference (Kruskal-Wallis Test)
- Tools: python and power bi

## Results
- In general, the total sales achieved by each restaurant varied significantly depending on characteristics such as location, market size, and the restaurantâ€™s age.
- Some findings also revealed that certain groups of restaurants achieved higher sales compared to others.
- Furthermore, under certain conditions, the three marketing strategies showed significant differences in total sales. This indicates that one or two strategies were deemed more effective than the others.
- For more detailed analysis and recommendations, please refer to the listed pdf documentation.
